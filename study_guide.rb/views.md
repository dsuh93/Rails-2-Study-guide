# Views - AAO Study Guide bullet examples
+ Demonstrate how to pass instance variables from controllers to HTML views for that controller

    - Concept: In the `Controller`, you must create `instance variables` in your action methods in order to utilize them in your `View` file for that specific action.

``` Ruby
#example from library_demo
    #while in app/controllers/books_controller.rb
    def index
  --> @books = Book.all
      render :index
    end
```
``` C#
    # while in app/views/books/new.html.erb -->
    <h1>all the books!</h1>
    <ul>
    # you can either do 
      <% @books.each do |book| %> 
        <%= render book %> 
      <% end %> 
    # or
      <%= render @books %> <--
    </ul>
```

+ Implement an HTML ERB form for creating a 'new' resource that will persist to a given database.

    - Concept: We want to create an `HTML form` layout inside one of our `ERB` files that will be used through our `new` action in our `Controller`.

``` Ruby
#example from library_demo
    #while in app/controllers/books_controller.rb
    def new
      @book = Book.find_by(id: params[:id])
      render :edit
    end
```
```Ruby
    #while in app/views/books/_form.html.erb

```

+ Implement an HTML ERB form for updating a user's existing resource that will persist to a given database.

+ Display model validation errors and custom error messages to a user on unsuccessful form submission

+ Create a form with radio buttons that will allow a user to choose from multiple values.

+ Demonstrate how to use a hidden field to overwrite a formâ€™s method allowing that form to update or delete a resource.
